# VBA_Challenge
Steve needed some things and guess what, I got em! It's the Module 2 Homework...
##But for Real..
The Purpose of this project was to edit,and refactor the Stock Market Dataset with VBA. I created a loop to process all the data at once to collect an entire dataser(is that what it's called?) for 2017 and 2018. I also recored the time it took to run such a beat of code.

## Results with Picture.. Yes Pictures!
 Below are images of the data collected from 2017 and 2018 along with their run times
